# Appendix Package

This folder contains the supplementary appendix referenced in the
paper submission.

- `appendix.pdf` – compiled appendix containing detailed theoretical
  analyses, architectural specifications, and extended results.
- `appendix.tex` – LaTeX source for the appendix if recompilation is
  required.

The PDF is self-contained. Recompiling the LaTeX source requires the
`ACM_SAC_2026_Article_Template` tree from the manuscript (for shared
macros and figure assets) together with a recent TeX Live distribution.
